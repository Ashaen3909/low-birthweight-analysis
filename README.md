# Low Birthweight Analysis

This project investigates the impact of maternal factors on low birthweight in infants using logistic regression techniques in R. It was completed as part of STAT2402 – Applied Statistics (2024).

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset includes 187 observations and variables such as:
- Maternal age and weight
- Race
- Smoking status
- Hypertension
- Uterine irritability
- Infant birthweight

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify key predictors of low birthweight
- Explore the relationship between maternal smoking and infant health
- Compare logistic regression models using AIC and deviance testing
- Interpret results using odds ratios and visual diagnostics

## 🧰 Tools & Methods

- **Language:** R
- **Models:** Logistic regression
- **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model selection, residual diagnostics
- **Key Metrics:** Odds Ratios, AIC, drop-in deviance test

## 📈 Key Findings

- Smoking increases the odds of low birthweight by **2.71x**
- Hypertension increases the odds by **6.31x**
- Higher maternal weight slightly reduces the risk
- The final model balances simplicity with predictive strength
